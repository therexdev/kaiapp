// distribution engine.

// SECURITY: the roster decides who gets paid, and it is plain external data
// fetched from a URL the user configured. Everything here is written for a
// hostile response — a size cap, a timeout, address validation, and a cap on
// how many addresses one response may contribute. Point this only at a roster
// you trust; an attacker who controls it can nominate payees (they still can't
// exceed the day's profit, and they still face the VHP gate when it is on).
