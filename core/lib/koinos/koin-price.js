/*
 * What the node is worth, and what it earns, in dollars.
 *
 * The price comes from the Uniswap v4 vKOIN/USDT pool — the same pool the
 * funding route already swaps through, and the only meaningful vKOIN
 * liquidity. vKOIN is KOIN bridged 1:1, so its price IS KOIN's price.
 *
 * Two things about that pool govern everything here, and both are stated in
 * the numbers this module returns rather than hidden behind a clean figure:
 *
 *   A QUOTE IS NOT A PRICE. Two things separate what the pool quotes from what
 *   every price site reports, and both have to be handled or the dashboard
 *   disagrees with the rest of the world:
 *
 *     THE FEE. This pool's tier is 1%, taken out of the input. Buying with
 *     `x` USDT swaps only `x * (1 - fee)`, so the quote implies a price of
 *     mid / (1 - fee) — about 1% high — no matter how small the trade. No
 *     probe size escapes it; it is removed arithmetically instead, which is
 *     exact rather than approximate.
 *
 *     PRICE IMPACT. The pool is thin, about $32k, so the probe moves it. This
 *     scales with size, so the probe is small: 10 USDT costs roughly 0.06%,
 *     where 100 USDT cost 0.6%.
 *
 *   Field-checked. With a 100 USDT probe and the fee left in, the dashboard
 *   read $0.0091 while every other venue said $0.008928 — 1.93% high, which
 *   is 1% fee plus 0.9% impact almost exactly. Both figures are kept: the
 *   market price is what a person means by "the price", and the executable
 *   one is what they would actually pay.
 *
 *   IT IS A DOLLAR VALUE OF A VOLATILE ASSET. Everything downstream is an
 *   estimate, and the yearly figure is an estimate built on an estimate: a
 *   recent daily rate, annualised, at today's price. It is not a forecast and
 *   the UI must not let it read as one.
 *
 * The split here is deliberate: every calculation is a pure function of
 * numbers that arrive as arguments, so the arithmetic — decimals, what counts
 * as value, what happens with no history — is testable without a network.
 * Only `fetchUsdPerKoin` touches Ethereum.
