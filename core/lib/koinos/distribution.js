// Community profit distribution.
//
// While the node produces, the engine watches the whole network: every check
// interval it reads the latest block headers and records each block's signer —
// a snapshot of which nodes are actually live and producing. Once a day (at a
// configurable UTC hour) it closes the cycle:
//
//   rewards      = KOIN minted to this node by block production this cycle
//   vhpConsumed  = VHP this node burned producing those blocks
//   profit       = rewards − vhpConsumed
//
//   1. The vhpConsumed portion is re-burned (KOIN → VHP) so this node's VHP —
//      and with it, its share of block production — stays level.
//   2. The profit is then carved up BY PERCENTAGE:
//        reburnPct        compounded back into VHP, on top of (1)
//        sharePct.ai        to every node running a Koinos AI Node
//        sharePct.producing to every node producing with the minimum VHP
//        sharePct.both      to nodes doing both, ON TOP of the two above
//        recipients[].pct  directly to each saved address, without pool gates
//      Membership overlaps: qualify for both requirements and you are paid from
//      all three pools. Each slice is split between the members of its pool
//      (plus that pool's carry from earlier cycles), and whatever the
//      percentages leave over simply stays in the wallet. This node counts as a
//      member like any other and keeps its own share.
//
// Both the reburn and the payouts go into a queue that is drained across
// checks, capped by the mana available right now (burning and sending KOIN
// each require mana >= amount on-chain), so a large distribution settles in
// chunks over hours instead of reverting.
//
// All figures come from on-chain block-production events (via ProducerStats),
// never balance deltas — deposits and manual burns are never distributed.
